<h2>Root::isNil</h2>

<br><b>Description:</b>
<br>isNil returns false by default.  Your classes should all inherit
this method (and should not override it) because it is desirable for
all objects in the system except for nil to return false from the
isNil message; only nil should return true.

<p>The isNil message in Epsilon takes the place of the comparison to
NULL in C++.

<p><b>Return value:</b> false
