<h1>Using Epsilon as a Component</h1>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Epsilon is a simple dialect of Smalltalk.  An interpreter for
Epsilon has been implemented in C++ for Solaris, including
a modest class library of simple data structures and 
<a href="classes.html">built-in classes</a>.

<p>
The Epsilon interpreter can be used as a reusable component
in your C++ applications.  This allows you to design your
applications to be highly configurable, because users can
then write their own customization scripts in Epsilon that
your application can load and pass to the Epsilon interpreter.

<p>
The easiest way to learn how to incorporate the interpreter
in your application is to look at the source file 
<a href="epsilonC.html">epsilon.C</a>,
which is quite short, and well documented.  This page further
explains each part of that source file.  First, we begin with
a suggested architecture for applications that use an 
embedded interpreter component.



<h2>Communication between Interpreter and Application</h2>

<p>
Applications that are to be programmable, or at least highly 
configurable, may be conceptualized as consisting of two
layers, the 'hard' layer, which is not programmable, and
the 'soft' layer, which is.

<p>
The soft layer is built on top of the hard layer.  The hard
layer provides a foundation for your application.  It contains
code objects that are expected to remain virtually unchanged
throughout the lifetime of the application, even as the code
evolves through future versions.

<p>
The soft layer is more dynamic, and can be modified, or
possibly even entirely replaced, by the user as the user
configures or customizes the system.  There are several ways
of achieving this.

<p>
The first way is to write the hard layer in C++ and the soft
layer in Epsilon.  This Epsilon source would be shipped with
your application and loaded at run-time by the hard layer.
By editing the Epsilon source code, the user can modify the
behavior of the soft layer.  However, since Epsilon is an
interpreted language, this may run too slowly in many cases.

<p>
Furthermore, requiring users to modify existing code may be
too demanding (and error-prone).

<p>
The other option is to write both layers in C++, but to 
provide surrogate Epsilon classes for each C++ class in 
the soft layer.  This way, the user's Epsilon code can
interface directly with the soft layer and modify its
behavior by sending messages to soft layer (C++) objects
through their Epsilon surrogates.

<p>
An elegant way of doing this is through subclassing.  If
users are provided with a set of soft layer surrogate
classes that they can subclass, then they will be thereby
empowered to modify soft layer behavior by overriding
(virtual) methods of classes in the soft layer.  You will
effectively have provided them with an application
framework into which they can insert their callback
functions.

<p>
For example:

<p>
<pre>
class MyEditor : Editor
{
   method onTab
}

method MyEditor::onTab
{
   self moveCursorX: (self cursorX + 3) Y: 0
}

main
{
   app registerEditor: MyEditor new
}
</pre>

<p>
Whenever the TAB key is pressed, the application would
call the onTab method of the user's MyEditor class,
which could contain virtually anything the user desires.
In this case, it simply moves the cursor 3 spaces to the
right, but one can easily envision more complex (and
interesting) behavior, such as context-sensitive tabbing
based on the alignment of text on surrounding lines.

<p>
In this way, you can provide a programmatic interface to
your application which your 'power-users' can use to
highly configure or customize the application.  For users
who do not need this much power, you can provide default code,
either in the interpreted language, or in C++.

<p>
The rest of this page describes in detail how to 
incorporate the reusable Epsilon interpreter component
into your application, and will hopefully make it clear 
that doing so need not entail the writing of
any more than a few hundred extra lines of code.

<p>
Given that you get the scanner, parser, code-generator,
and garbage-collector for free, a few hundred lines of
code is a very small price to pay for a complete interpreter.


<p>
<h2>Details</h2>

<p>
<h3>Top Level</h3>
The main routine has the following form:

<p>
<pre>
void main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
  try
    {
      ...

      // Try to execute the source file
      go(Buffer);
    }
  catch(const LEXICAL_ERROR &amp;le)
    {
      cout &lt;&lt; "Lexical error on line " &lt;&lt; le.GetEpsilonLineNum() &lt;&lt;
	" in file \"" &lt;&lt; "\"" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  catch(const READ_ERROR &amp;)
    {
      cout &lt;&lt; "Read error" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>
main() consists of an exception handler that catches
exceptions for syntax errors and other types of errors
in the user's code.

<p>
<h3>The go() Routine</h3>

<p>
The go() routine is as follows:

<p>
<pre>
void go(const StringObject &amp;filename)
{
  EpsilonInterpreter interpreter;

  registerBuiltInClasses(interpreter);
  registerBuiltInObjects(interpreter);

  ifstream is(filename.AsCharArray());
  if(!is.good())
    throw FILE_EXCEPTION(__FILE__,__LINE__);

  interpreter.parseCode(is);

  if(!interpreter.doesMainExist())
    {
      cout &lt;&lt; "You have not defined main()!" &lt;&lt; endl;
      return;
    }

  interpreter.executeMain();
}
</pre>

<p>
This routine begins by allocating an object of type
EpsilonInterpreter.  It then registers built-in 
classes and objects with the interpreter (explained
below).

<p>
go() then opens an istream for the source file and
passes that istream to the parseCode() method.  This
causes the interpreter to parse your user's code
and to store the generated code inside the interpreter.

<p>
Before executing the user's code, you should make sure
the user has provided a main routine; this can be 
accomplished via the doesMainExist() method.

<p>
Finally, you can execute the user's main() routine 
via executeMain().  main() allows the user to register
callback objects with the application, so you will 
typically only want to do this once, just after loading
the user's source code.  Once the user has registered
his/her callback objects, you can send messages directly 
to  those objects at any time during application
execution.  Thus, it is only necessary to call the user's
main() routine once, in order to bootstrap his/her code.


<p>
<h3>Registering Built-In Classes</h3>

<p>
The registerBuiltInClasses function in epsilon.C contains
only comments that describe how to write your own version
of this function:

<p>
<pre>
void registerBuiltInClasses(EpsilonInterpreter &amp;interpreter)
{
  // 1. Create &amp; register your classes using 
  //       Class *c=interpreter.createClass("&lt;name&gt;");
  //       (automatically registered)
  //    or
  //       Class *c=new DerivedFromClass(...);
  //       (not automatically registered; you must do it)
  //       interpreter.registerClass(c);

  // 2. Add instance methods &amp; class methods to your class:
  //       interpreter.addInstanceMethod(c,"&lt;methodName&gt;",
  //          &amp;cPlusPlusFunction);
  //    or
  //       interpreter.addInstanceMethod(c,"&lt;methodName&gt;",
  //          "&lt;epsilon source code&gt;");
}
</pre>

<p>
An example registerBuiltInClasses() function containing actual
code is as follows:

<p>
<pre>
Class * thingamajig;
Object *hickup(RunTimeEnvironment &amp;env);

void registerBuiltInClasses(EpsilonInterpreter &amp;interpreter)
{
  // Create a class called 'thingamajig'
  thingamajig=interpreter.createClass("thingamajig");
  interpreter.addInstanceMethod(thingamajig,"print:",
    "method thingamajig::print: p { cout &lt;&lt; '[' &lt;&lt; p &lt;&lt; ']' }");
  interpreter.addInstanceMethod(thingamajig,"hickup",&amp;hickup);

  // ----------------------------------------------------------

  // Create a class called 'thingamadoober'
  thingamadoober=new thingamadooberClass();
  interpreter.registerClass(thingamadoober);
  interpreter.addInstanceMethod(thingamadoober,"init:",
			&amp;thingamadooberObject::init);
  interpreter.addInstanceMethod(thingamadoober,"hasMoreTokens",
			&amp;thingamadooberObject::hasMoreTokens);
  interpreter.addInstanceMethod(thingamadoober,"nextToken",
			&amp;thingamadooberObject::nextToken);
}
</pre>

<p>
This registerBuiltInClasses() function registers two classes,
thingamajig and thingamadoober.  Notice that thingamajig has
two instance methods, print: and hickup.  The former is defined
in the Epsilon language by providing a string literal containing
the actual Epsilon code defining the body.

<p>
The hickup instance method is defined using a C++ function:

<p>
<pre>
Object *hickup(RunTimeEnvironment &amp;env)
{
  // Get self
  thingamajig *self=(thingamajig*) env.GetSelf();

  // Get parameter(s)
  // &lt;none&gt;

  // Perform operation
  cout &lt;&lt; "hickup!" &lt;&lt; endl;

  // return result
  return self;
}
</pre>

<p>
You may use C++ methods rather than functions for this purpose,
but if you use methods, they must be static.  

<p>
hickup() begins by retrieving the 'self' pointer from the
run-time-stack.  This was not necessary in this example, but
it usually is, because you often need to know to which object
the message is being sent; 'self' is the recipient of the 
message implemented by this method (hickup).

<p>
hickup() did not require any parameters, but if it did,
they could be retrieved as follows:

<p>
<pre>
   String_Object *parm1=
      DYNAMIC_CAST_PTR(String_Object,env.GetParameter(1));
   if(parm1==NULL)
      throw RUN_TIME_ERROR(__FILE__,__LINE__,
         "Method hickup requires a string parameter!");
</pre>

<p>
The DYNAMIC_CAST_PTR macro can be replaced by dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;()
if your compiler supports RTTI directly.

<p>
You must verify that the dynamic cast succeeded, because
the user could have passed the wrong type of object, since
Epsilon (like smalltalk) is an untyped language (i.e., static
type checking is not possible).

<p>
After performing the operation, your method should return
an Object result; if your method produces no useful result,
you should follow the convention of returning 'self.'

<p>
<h3>Registering Built-In Objects</h3>

<p>
Now consider the registerBuiltInObjects() function:

<p>
<pre>
void registerBuiltInObjects(EpsilonInterpreter &amp;interpreter)
{
  // Declare your global objects here using
  //    int lexAddr=interpreter.declareGlobalObject("&lt;name&gt;");

  // Allow the interpreter to allocate space at the bottom of
  // the run-time-stack for all global objects
  interpreter.allocateGlobalSpace();

  // Store your global objects on the stack using
  //     interpreter.storeGlobalObject(&lt;object-ptr&gt;,lexAddr);
}
</pre>

<p>
You must follow the pattern of (1) declaring your objects,
(2) allocating global space, and (3) storing your objects
on the stack.  Performing these steps in the wrong order
would be very bad.

<p>
Here is an example registerBuiltInObjects() function:

<p>
<pre>
void registerBuiltInObjects(EpsilonInterpreter &amp;interpreter)
{
  int lexAddr=interpreter.declareGlobalObject("hoojabob");

  interpreter.allocateGlobalSpace();

  thingamadooberObject *hoojabob=
    new thingamadooberObject(thingamadoober,0);
  interpreter.storeGlobalObject(hoojabob,lexAddr);
}
</pre>

<p>
This function declares an object called "hoojabob."  Then
the interpreter is asked to allocated global space for
all global objects.  If you had other global objects to 
declare, you would have declared them before calling
allocateGlobalSpace().

<p>
Finally, this function allocates the hoojabob object and
stores it on the stack using storeGlobalObject().  The
integer variable, lexAddr, is simply a lexical address
that the interpreter uses as a handle to the object.  The
lexical address returned by the declareGlobalObject()
method must be passed to the storeGlobalObject() method.
Each global object will have a unique lexical address.



<h2>The epscomp.a Library</h2>

<p>To use the Epsilon component, your makefile will need
to be modified so that you link in the epscomp.a library.



<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
It is hoped that the reader has by now realized that an
appropriately packaged interpreter component for any
interpreted language can be incorporated into an application
with very little effort.  The power of providing a
programmatic interface to an application for the purpose
of configuration or customization is obvious.

<p>
I have presented here a description of the Epsilon interpreter
component, but the approach taken to package the interpreter
as a reusable component could also be applied to other
interpreted languages.  

<p>
Given the popularity of C++ and
Java, it would be nice to have a Java-based interpreter
component to use instead of Epsilon, since Smalltalk is
less well-known by programmers and other users likely
to take advantage of a programmatic interface to an
application.  

<p>
Visual BASIC is another promising possibility, because of its
simplicity and popularity,
as has already been shown by the VB interfaces to Microsoft
Excel and Access.
