<h1>Block</h1>

<br><b>Derived from:</b>Block
<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>A Block instance represents a block construct in an Epsilon
program.  A block construct appears in a program as a pair of
brackets containing a list of statements and 0 to 3 parameters.

<p>When flow-of-control reaches a block construct in an Epsilon
program, the entire construct evaluates to a Block instance,
but the statements inside the block are not executed at this
time.  To execute the statements inside a block, you must send
the Block instance representing that block construct an
<i>evaluate</i> message.

<p>There are four such <i>evaluate</i> messages, as shown in the
list of methods, below.  Each <i>evaluate</i> message handles blocks
with a different number of parameters.  It is an error to pass
more parameters to a block than it can handle.  Passing too few
simply results in the rightmost parameters being bound to
<a href="nil.html">nil</a>.

<p>While-statements and until-statements are emulated by sending
<a href="blkwhilt.html">whileTrue:</a>,
<a href="blkwhilf.html">whileFalse:</a>,
or <a href="blkuntil.html">until:</a> messages to blocks.

<p>The Block class cannot be explicitly instantiated nor subclassed,
because it is a restricted class.
