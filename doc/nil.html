<h1>Nil</h1>

<br><b>Derived from:</b>Root
<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>Nil is the class of the built-in object <i>nil</i>.  Nil is
restricted, so it cannot be instantiated explicitly; nor can it be
subclassed.  

<p>nil is used much the same as NULL in C++, but it has
a different meaning.  NULL in C++ is a pointer that does not
point to any object, but nil actually denotes an object
(an instance of the class Nil).

<p>Rather than testing whether an identifier currently
refers to an object (as you might do in C++ by comparing a pointer
to NULL), we send the denoted object the isNil message, which
returns true for instances of Nil and false for instances of Root
and subclasses which do not override the isNil method.
