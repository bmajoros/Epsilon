<h1>Meta</h1>

<br><b>Derived from:</b>
<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>Meta is the base class for all metaclasses.  Every class (except
for the metaclasses) has a metaclass.  When you declare a new class,
a metaclass is automatically created for the new class.  This metaclass
has no name, but is sometimes shown as "meta~SomeClass" in interpreter
messages.

<p>Class attributes and class methods declared for a class
are actually instance attributes and instance methods on the
metaclass.  The declared class is considered to be an instance
of its metaclass, so these attributes and methods actually belong
to the class, rather than to its instances.

<p>A class' metaclass is automatically a subclass of the class'
superclass' metaclass.  That is, if class B is derived from A, then
meta~B is implicitly derived from meta~A.  Thus, each class that you
declare automatically inherits the instance attributes and methods
of Meta (as class attributes and class methods, respectively).

<p>The most practical result of this fact is that classes can be
instantiated by sending them Meta's "new" message; in fact, this is
the only way to instantiate objects in Epsilon.

<p>You cannot instantiate nor inherit from Meta, because it is a
restricted class.
