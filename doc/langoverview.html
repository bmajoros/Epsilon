<title>Epsilon Language Overview</title>
<!-- Changed by: Bill Majoros,  2-May-1997 -->
<h1>Epsilon Language Overview</h1>

<p>
This is an overview of the Epsilon language, which is a
simple dialect of Smalltalk.  Knowlege of Smalltalk is
helpful, but not required.  You must, however, understand
object-oriented programming.  

<p>
<h2>main</h2>

<p>
Every program must contain a main routine.  Here is an example:

<p>
<pre>
main
{
   cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, world!\n"
}
</pre>

<p>
This main routine prints "Hello, world!" to STDOUT.  It achieves this
by sending the &lt;&lt; message (actually an overloaded operator) to
the 'cout' object, with the string "Hello, world!\n" as a parameter
to that method.

<p>
Built-in objects, such as cout, and the details are message-sending
are described later.

<p>
<h2>Declaring Classes</h2>

<p>
Epsilon has several built-in classes, but you can also declare your
own classes, as follows:

<p>
<pre>
class &lt;class-name&gt;
{
   &lt;member-declarations&gt;
}
</pre>

<p>
For example, here is a typical Pair class:

<p>
<pre>
class Pair : Root
{
   attribute a, b.
   method initA: iA B: iB.
   method getA.
   method getB
}
</pre>

<p>
This class defines objects that can store a pair of other objects.
It has two attributes, a and b, for storing the two objects in 
the pair, and it has three methods.  The initA:B: method takes
two parameters, iA and iB.  The getA and getB methods each take
zero parameters.  Except for the overloaded operators, a method
generally takes a number of parameters equal to the number of
colons (:) in its name.

<p>
The bodies of these methods are not given here; they must be
defined after the class declaration.  We will see how to do 
this later.

<p>
Notice that the types of the attributes and method parameters
(as well as the return types of the methods) are unspecified.
This is because Epsilon, like Smalltalk, is an untyped language.

<p>
The ": Root" part of the declaration specifies that the Pair
class is derived from  Root, which is a built-in class
(built-in classes are described later).  This means that
Pair inherits all of Root's instance members and class members.

<p>
C++ programmers should note that all methods in Epsilon are
virtual.  You cannot create nonvirtual methods in this language.

<p>
You should also note that constructors and destructors do not
exist in this language, although you can simulate constructors
by creating "init" methods, like the "initA:B:" method shown above.

<p>
<h2>Defining Methods</h2>

<p>
We can define Pair's initA:B: method as follows:

<p>
<pre>
method Pair::initA: iA initB: iB
{
   bind a to iA.
   bind b to iB
}
</pre>

<p>
This method binds the Pair's 'a' and 'b' attributes to
the iA and iB parameters, respectively.  

<p>It is important to
understand this 'binding' process well, because it is
quite different from assignment in most programming languages,
although it is similar to assignment in Java.  When a
variable is bound to an expression, the variable is caused to
refer to the object resulting from evaluation of that 
expression.  A variable is not an object, so binding a
variable to an object does not entail the copying of an
object from one region of memory to another.  It is very
much like references in C++.

<p>
Notice that initA:B: does not explicitly return a
value.  Every method must return a value.  If you do
not explicitly return a value, the special variable
'self' will be implicitly returned for you.  'self'
is a variable which always refers to the object
receiving the current message.  In this case, self
is a Pair.

<p>
The other two Pair methods can be defined as follows:

<p>
<pre>
method Pair::getA
{
   ^a
}

method Pair::getB
{
   ^b
}
</pre>

<p>
These methods explicitly return the values a and b.  The
^ operator is equivalent to a return statement in a 
traditional programming language.

<p>
<h2>Metaclasses</h2>

<p>
The notion of a 'metaclass' can be a little confusing for
programmers of traditional languages, including C++.  It
is an important concept, however, because it accounts
for the difference between class members and instance
members of a class.

<p>
In Epsilon, a class is actually considered an object;
thus, you can send a message to classes as well as
sending messages to objects.

<p>
Since a class is an object, it must therefore be an
instance of some other class.  We call this 'other class'
the metaclass of the class.

<p>
For example, consider the class hierarchy shown in 
the diagram below:

<p><img src="hierarch.gif">

<p>
The red lines show "instance of" relations, and the blue
lines denote derivation.  We can see that a Canary is
a type of Bird, which is a type of Animal, and
Animal is derived from Root (because all classes in
Epsilon must ultimately be derived from Root).

<p>
Canary is both a class and an object (because all classes
are objects, in addition to being classes).  We can see
that Canary is, in fact, an instance of class meta~Canary.
Thus, meta~Canary is the metaclass of Canary.  Likewise,
meta~Bird and meta~Animal are the metaclasses of Bird
and Animal, respectively.

<p>
When you declare a class in Epsilon, a metaclass is 
automatically created for your class.  Thus, simply
declaring the classes Animal, Bird, and Canary will
give rise to the hierarchy shown above (assuming the
proper inheritance structure).

<p>
Furthermore, metaclasses always form an inheritance 
hierarchy parallel to that of their instance classes.
That is, meta~Bird is derived from meta~Animal automatically
by virtue of the fact that Bird is derived from Animal.

<p>
<h2>Class vs. Instance Members</h2>

<p>
C++ programmers often are not aware of the difference
between class members and instance members.  An 
instance member is a member belonging to an instance
of the class in question, whereas a class member
belongs not to instances of the class, but to 
the class itself.  They are much like static members
in C++.

<p>
Thus, if class C has a class method called new
and an instance method called init, then the new
message can be send to C, and the init message can
be send to instance of C.

<p>
This distinction is related to metaclasses in the
following way:  class members actually belong to
a class' metaclass, whereas instance members belong
to the class.  

<p>
This is consistent with the idea that
an object's behavior is governed by its type, or
class.  When an object receives a message, the
message name is looked up in the object's class
in order to determine how the object should respond
to the message.  Likewise, since a class is an
object, a message sent to a class is looked-up
on the class's metaclass to see how the class
should respond.  This allows the message-dispatching
mechanism to function identically for both class
methods and instance methods.

<p>
<h2>Creating Objects</h2>

<p>
An object is created by sending the <i>new</i> message
to a class.  The result of this message-send is a new
instance of the class.

<p>
<i>new</i> is actually a class method inherited by all
classes.  If you do not define <i>new</i> in your
class, the inherited method will be invoked when <i>
new</i> is sent to your class.  This is acceptable
because the new object that is created will always
be an instance of the most derived class to which it
was sent.  That is, the type of the new object will
<b>not</b> be the superclass from which your class
inherited <i>new</i>; the object will actually be
an instance of your class.

<p>
If you do decide to override <i>new</i>, you should
call the superclass version within your override:

<p>
<pre>
method MyClass::new
{
   ^super new init
}
</pre>

<p>
This method sends new to 'super,' which denotes MyClass'
superclass.  The result is a new object of type
MyClass.  This object is then sent the <i>init</i> message.
Finally, the ^ operator is used to return the newly
initialized object.

<p>
<h2>The == Operator</h2>

<p>
The == operator behaves differently in Epsilon than in 
most other languages.  Rather than comparing two objects
for equality, == simply decides whether two expressions
evaluate to <i>exactly</i> the same objects.  Two objects
of the same type and identical attributes will <b>not</b>
test equal under ==, because they are not the <i>same</i>
object.

<p>
<h2>nil</h2>

<p>
The built-in object, nil, is a special object that takes
the place of NULL and null in C++ and Java, respectively.
nil, however, is not a NULL pointer; it is truly an
object, and you can send messages to that object.  The
only really useful message that nil can respond to is
the <i>isNil</i> message, which always returns true
(for nil).  All other objects return false fro this
message, so rather than comparing an object to nil
via the == operator, you can send it the <i>isNil</i>
message.

<p>
<h2>Local Variables</h2>

<p>
Local variables within methods are declared using the
<b>object</b> keyword:

<p>
<pre>
object x, y.
bind x to Pair getA.
bind y to Pair getB.
</pre>

<p>
The code above declares two local variables, x and y, and then
proceeds to bind them to the elements of a Pair.  You may 
not explicitly initialize the objects on their declaration
line using an = operator, as you can in C++.  They will
be initialized to nil at the point of declaration, and you
can then bind them to other objects after the declaration.

<p>
A variable's scope begins at its declaration and extends to
the end of the current block, or to the end of the method
if the declaration is not inside a block. 

<p>
You cannot declare global variables.

<p>
<h2>Sending Messages to Objects</h2>

<p>
There are several different types of message that can be sent
to objects, but all message-sends generally consist of
a recipient object followed by a message name, followed
by the message parameters.

<p>
<h3>Unary Message</h3>

<p>
A unary message is one which takes no parameters.  The name
of a unary message does not contain any colons (:).  The
<i>new</i> message is a unary message.  It can be sent
to a class as follows:

<p>
<pre>
MyClass new
</pre>

<p>
Unary messages, or 'selectors' have highest precedence.

<p>
<h3>Binary Operators</h3>

<p>
A binary operator, such as '+', can be used much like in other
languages:

<p>
<pre>
x+y
</pre>

<p>
The above expression is a message send; it sends the '+' 
message to the object to which x is bound, with y as a
parameter.  The expression evaluates to the object returned
by the '+' message.

<p>
Binary operators have lower precedence than unary selecrtors.

<p>
<h3>Keyword Selectors</h3>

<p>
A 'keyword selector' is a general message-send with multiple
parameters.  It consists of a recipient object followed
by the selector (the method name), with actual parameters
interspersed among the parts of the message name:

<p>
<pre>
cursor gotoX: 22 Y: 34.
</pre>

<p>
The statement above sends the gotoX:Y: message to the cursor
object, passing 22 and 34 as the parameters.

<p>
Here's another example:

<p>
<pre>
bind file to File open: "myfile.txt" mode: OF_READ share: OFS_EXCLUSIVE
</pre>

<p>
This sends the open:mode:share: message to the File class, which 
results in an object of type File, representing the file that has 
(hopefully) been opened.  The parameters to this message are 
"myfile.txt", OF_READ, and OFS_EXCLUSIVE.

<p>
Keyword selectors have lower precedence than binary operators.

<p>
<h2>Built-In Classes</h2>

<p>
The 
<a href="classes.html">built-in classes</a> 
are described elsewhere in more detail, but we will briefly mention
the important classes here.

<p>
The Integer and Float classes represent numbers, and provide
common arithmetic and comparison operators, such as +, -, &lt;, 
and &gt;.  

<p>
The String class represents a character string.  Note that
string literals appearing in your source code are automatically
compiled into String objects, so you can do things like this:

<p>
<pre>
"Hello, world" equal: myString
</pre>

<p>
This expression causes the equal: message to be sent to
"Hello, world", with myString as a parameter.  The result
will be an instance of the True class or the False class
(see Built-In Objects, below).  

<p>
<h2>The Block Class</h2>
<p>
Another very important class is the Block class.  Blocks
are used to implement all of the flow-of-control constructs
in the language.

<p>
For example, consider the following code:

<p>
<pre>
bind x to 1.
[x<10] whileTrue:
  [
  bind x to x+1
  ]
</pre>

<p>
This code binds x to an Integer object having value 1, and then
sends the whileTrue: message to the Block object [x<10].  The
second Block, [bind x to x+1], is passed as a parameter to
the whileTrue: method.

<p>
The whileTrue: method repeatedly executes its parameter Block
(which is [bind x to x+1] in this case), until the expression
in the recipient block, [x<10] evaluates to the false object.

<p>
In like fashion, the other flow-of-control constructs are defined
as methods of built-in classes.  All flow-of-control constructs
are described in a later section.

<p>
Note that a block can accept parameters:

<p>
<pre>
[:i :j | cout &lt;&lt; i+j ] evaluateOn: 3 and: 4
</pre>

<p>
This code sends the evaluateOn:and: message to the Block, passing
3 and 4 (both Integer objects) as parameters.  This message
causes the block to be evaluated, with the Block parameters
(i and j) bound to the actual message parameters (3 and 4).

<p>
Block parameters are often employed when iterating over
collections:

<p>
<pre>
someCollection foreach:
  [ :e | cout &lt;&lt; e ]
</pre>

<p>
If someCollection is an object of some class having a foreach:
message, this will likely cause the block to be evaluated once
for each element in the collection, with the Block parameter, e,
bound to each successive element in the iteration.

<p>
Blocks may contain more than one statement.  You must separate
statements with a period (.).  However, the last statement must
not be terminated by a period:

<p>
<pre>
employees foreach:
  [ :emp |
     emp increaseSalary: 0.25.
     emp notify: "Your new salary is $" + (emp getSalary)
  ]
</pre>

<p>
A block evaluates to the value of the last statement in the
block.  Thus, if the notify: message in the last line of the
block shown above returns some object, x, then the entire
block will evaluate to x when the block is executed.

<p>
<h2>Return Statements Within a Block</h2>

<p>
A block is much like a procedure, since it takes parameters
and can be "called."  However, return statements inside
a block do not return from the invocation of the block,
but from invocation of the method containing the block.

<p>
Consider an example:

<p>
<pre>
method List::get: x
{
  elements foreach:
    [ :e |
       (e getKey equal: x) ifTrue:
          [^e]
    ]
}
</pre>

<p>
This code iterates through the collection called 'elements,'
invoking the outer block once for each element.  When
the expression (e getKey equals: x) evaluates to true, the
ifTrue: message will cause the inner block [^e] to be
executed.

<p>
This block simply returns e.  However, this return statement
returns from the List::get: method, not just from the inner
block.

<p>
<h2>Closures</h2>

<p>
Blocks are sometimes called <i>closures</i>, because of their
behavior regarding static scoping.  

<p>
When the flow-of-control reaches a block, the block is 
instantiated as a Block object.  The Block object may then
be passed as a parameter to a routine, such as whileTrue:.
Since the Block is a first-class object, just like other
objects, it can be stored in data structures.  It could
even be returned from a method.

<p>
The significance of this fact becomes clear when one considers
that the expressions in the block may contain references to
local variables in the enclosing method.  If the Block object
is still accessible after the method returns, then the
expressions in the Block may refer to local variables that
have gone out of scope.

<p>
Normally, when a variable goes out of scope, its memory is
reclaimed by the garbage collector.  However, when a Block
object is created, a <i>closure</i> is formed around the
block, effectively "locking" all enclosing scopes for
the lifetime of the block.  In this way, the garbage
collector is prevented from reclaiming variables in any
enclosing scope until the Block itself is deallocated.

<p>
<h2>Built-In Objects</h2>

<p>
There are currently only 3 built-in objects in Epsilon,
true, false, and nil.  

<p>
The true object is an instance of class True, which 
always responds positively to ifTrue: messages and
negatively to ifFalse: messages.

<p>
Conversly, the false object always responds negatively
to ifTrue: messages and positively to ifFalse:.

<p>
<h2>Control Constructs</h2>

<p>
We have already seen the whileTrue: method of the Block class.
A whileFalse: method is defined similarly, and the until:
method works much like the do..until construct in other
languages:

<p>
<pre>
[ bind x to x+1 ] until: [x equal: 10]
</pre>

<p>
A for-loop construct is simulated by the upTo:do: method
of the Integer class:

<p>
<pre>
1 upTo: 10 do: [ :i | cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n' ]
</pre>

<p>
This will cause the block to be invoked once for each
integer in the range 1..10, with the block parameter, i,
bound to each successive integer value in that range.

<p>
A block can be evaluated some fixed number of times via
the timesDo: method of Integer:

<p>
<pre>
10 timesDo: [ cout &lt;&lt; '*' ]
</pre>

<p>
A block can be invoked once for each element of an
array:

<p>
<pre>
object array.
bind array to Array new setSize: 10.
1 upTo: 10 do: [:i|array at: i put: i*2].
array do: [:elem|cout &lt;&lt; elem &lt;&lt; '\n' ]
</pre>

<p>
<h2>Class Library</h2>
