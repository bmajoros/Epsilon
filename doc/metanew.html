<h2>Meta::new</h2>

<br><b>Description:</b>
<br>Instantiates the recipient class.  Since Meta is a restricted class,
you cannot instantiate it explicitly; Meta's instances are all
classes.  Meta::new instantiates whichever one of these classes
receives the <i>new</i> message.

<p>You should override <i>new</i> in your classes (as a class method)
to instantiate the class and initialize the resulting object.  This
is usually achieved by some variant on:

<p>		method MyClass::new
<br>			{
<br>			^super new init
<br>			}

<p>This code will invoke the <i>new</i> method of MyClass' super-class
and send the <i>init</i> instance method (which you must define) to
the resulting instance, before returning it.

<p>Overriding <i>new</i> ensures that your
objects are properly constructed
before they are used.  If you simply inherit Meta::new as-is and allow
your clients to use it directly, they may accidentally use the
objects without initializing them, which can be disasterous.  The
object's attributes would all be initialized to <i>nil</i>,
but this is usually not enough.

<p>Often, you will need for <i>new</i> to accept one or more
arguments in order to properly contruct a new object.  Meta::new
does not take any parameters, however, so the solution is to provide
another means of instantiation; i.e., a different class method, such
as MyClass::newSetX:SetY:.  
<p>If you do this, you should also disable Meta::new to force your
clients to instantiate your class with the proper class method.  You
can disable Meta::new for your class by overriding it with a method
that sends itself the <a href="metaerr.html">error:</a> message.

<p><b>Return value:</b> An instance of the recipient class
