<h2>Block evaluation methods</h2>

<br><b>Block::evaluateOn: P</b>
<br><b>Block::evaluateOn: P and: Q</b>
<br><b>Block::evaluateOn: P and: Q and: R</b>

<p><b>Description:</b>
<br>Causes block's contents to be executed.  The value of the last
statement is returned, even if no <i>return</i> statement was
executed.  (In fact, if a return statement executes, the block may
cause the stack to unwind to a previous context).

<p>The block must be of sufficient arity (i.e., must have at
least as many parameters as there are arguments).
P, Q, and R are any objects, and
will be bound to the block's formal parameters in a left-to-right
fashion.  Any superfluous formal parameters are bound to nil.

<p>To evaluate a block taking no parameters, see

<p><b>Return value:</b> Value of last statement
